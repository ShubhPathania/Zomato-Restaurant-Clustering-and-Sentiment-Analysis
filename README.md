# Introduction
This project delves into the power of unsupervised machine learning to unlock valuable customer insights from Zomato's vast user data, focusing on the delivery service experience. By analyzing user reviews and exploring restaurant data, we aim to develop a system that empowers Zomato to:

- **Personalize delivery services:** Cater to individual user preferences, enhancing the overall delivery experience.
- **Optimize service efficiency:** Leverage data-driven insights to improve delivery times and resource allocation.
- **Empower restaurants:** Equip restaurants with valuable customer sentiment analysis to improve service and cater to customer expectations.

# Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to uncover customer preferences and sentiments to enhance service delivery for restaurants on Zomato using unsupervised machine learning techniques. This involves analyzing user reviews to understand overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and clustering restaurants based on a combination of features to personalize user discovery.

# üìù Project Highlights
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Implemented robust techniques to ensure data quality by handling missing values, outliers and inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted in-depth EDA to uncover trends and patterns in user reviews and restaurant data. This included analyzing the distribution of user ratings, identifying frequently mentioned aspects of restaurants (e.g., cuisine, cost, reviews) and exploring sentiment variations across different restaurant categories.
- **Text Processing:** Employed techniques like ***stemming*** and ***TF-IDF*** to transform text reviews into numerical vectors suitable for machine learning algorithms.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Developed a system to analyze user reviews and classify sentiment towards restaurants (positive, negative, neutral), providing valuable feedback for restaurants.
- **Model Development:** Implemented and evaluated four sentiment analysis models: MultinomialNB, Random Forest Classifier, Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBoost), and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). **XGBoost** and **Support Vector Classifiers** achieved the highest **accuracy scores**, both **exceeding 94%**.
- **Topic Modeling:** Implemented ***Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)*** to uncover latent topics discussed frequently in user reviews. This provided insights into broader customer concerns and preferences beyond sentiment analysis.
- **Cluster Analysis:** Applied ***K-means clustering*** and ***Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering*** and employed silhouette score and Elbow method to assess the effectiveness of restaurant clustering.

# üîë Key Insights
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Accurate sentiment analysis offers actionable insights for restaurants to improve their service delivery and meet customer expectations.
- **Restaurant Clustering:** Effective clustering helps users discover restaurants that match their preferences, enhancing their overall experience on the platform.
- **High Model Accuracy:** The achieved high accuracy of XGB Classifier and SVC models demonstrates the project's potential to contribute to a user-centric and data-driven platform.

# üìú Conclusion
This project successfully leveraged unsupervised machine learning to extract valuable insights from Zomato's user data. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of customer preferences and sentiment, enabling Zomato to enhance service delivery and create a more personalized user experience. The insights gained from this project can help Zomato and restaurant owners better understand their customers, leading to improved service delivery and customer satisfaction.
